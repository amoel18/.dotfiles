Let V be an F -vector space.

Denition (3.1)
The vector space

V 0 := Hom(V , F) = {y : V → F | y

is linear}

is called the dual space of V .
The elements y ∈ V 0 are called linear functionals (or linear
forms).

Let B = {xi | i ∈ I } be a basis for V parametrised by some
index set I .

Denition

Let i ∈ I . The linear functional yi ∈ V 0 given by
X
yi (
αj xj ) = αi
j∈I

is called the i 'th coordinate functional.
P
So if x ∈ V is written as x = i∈I αi xi , then yi (x) = αi .

B = {xi | i ∈ I } is a basis parametrised by I .
Let B 0 = {yi | i ∈ I } ⊆ V 0 be the coordinate functionals.

Theorem (3.4)
The set B0 is linearly independent. If dim V < ∞ then
X
y (xi )yi
for all y ∈ V 0
y=
i∈I

and B0 is a basis for the dual space V 0 .

Denition

When V is nite-dimensional with basis B , then B 0 (of
coordinate functionals) is called the dual basis og B .
Note that the dual basis B 0 is a basis for V 0 (Theorem 3.4).

Let U ⊆ V be a subspace.

Denition

The subspace

U ◦ := {y ∈ V 0 | y (x) = 0

for all x ∈ U}

is called the annihilator of U .
U ◦ is a subspace.
Indeed, if y (1) , y (2) ∈ U ◦ then for every x ∈ U we have

(y (1) + y (2) )(x) = y (1) (x) + y (2) (x) = 0
| {z } | {z }
=0

=0

so y (1) + y (2) ∈ U ◦ . Similarly αy ∈ U ◦ whenever y ∈ U ◦ and
α ∈ F.

U ◦ := {y ∈ V 0 | y (x) = 0

for all x ∈ U}

Let V = R2 with the standard ordered basis (e1 , e2 ).
Let y1 , y2 ∈ (R2 )0 be the coordinate functionals, so

U ◦ := {y ∈ V 0 | y (x) = 0

for all x ∈ U}

Let V = R2 with the standard ordered basis (e1 , e2 ).
Let y1 , y2 ∈ (R2 )0 be the coordinate functionals, so

and since x ∈ U was arbitrary, it follows that y1 ∈ U ◦ .

U ◦ := {y ∈ V 0 | y (x) = 0

for all x ∈ U}

Let V = R2 with the standard ordered basis (e1 , e2 ).
Let y1 , y2 ∈ (R2 )0 be the coordinate functionals, so

so if we pick for instance x = e2 (corresponding to α = 1)
then y2 (x) = 1 6= 0. Hence y2 ∈
/ U ◦.

Let U ⊆ V be a subspace, and let π : V → V /U be the
projection.

Theorem (3.8)
There is an isomorphism (V /U)0 → U ◦ given by z 7→ z ◦ π .
In particular, if V is nite-dimensional, then
dim U + dim U ◦ = dim V .
Remark: (V /U)0 consists of linear maps z : V /U → F
and π : V → V /U is linear.
So z ◦ π : V → F is a linear map, and hence z ◦ π ∈ V 0 .

Proof.

Let A : (V /U)0 → V 0 be the linear map Az = z ◦ π .
Goal: to show R(A) = U ◦ and N(A) = {0}. Then A induces
an isomorphism (V /U)0 → U ◦ by the rst isomorphism
theorem.

Let U ⊆ V be a subspace, and let π : V → V /U be the
projection.

Theorem (3.8)
There is an isomorphism (V /U)0 → U ◦ given by z 7→ z ◦ π .
In particular, if V is nite-dimensional, then
dim U + dim U ◦ = dim V .

Proof.

Let A : (V /U)0 → V 0 be the linear map Az = z ◦ π .
Goal: to show R(A) = U ◦ and N(A) = {0}. Then A induces
an isomorphism (V /U)0 → U ◦ by the rst isomorphism
theorem.
N(A) = {0}: Suppose Az = z ◦ π = 0. Goal: z(x) = 0 for all
x ∈ V /U . Pick x 0 ∈ V such that π(x 0 ) = x . Then
z(x) = z(π(x 0 )) = (Az)(x 0 ) = 0. Hence z = 0, so
N(A) = {0}.

Let U ⊆ V be a subspace, and let π : V → V /U be the
projection.

Theorem (3.8)
There is an isomorphism (V /U)0 → U ◦ given by z 7→ z ◦ π .
In particular, if V is nite-dimensional, then
dim U + dim U ◦ = dim V .

Proof.

Let A : (V /U)0 → V 0 be the linear map Az = z ◦ π .
Goal: to show R(A) = U ◦ and N(A) = {0}. Then A induces
an isomorphism (V /U)0 → U ◦ by the rst isomorphism
theorem.
R(A) ⊆ U ◦ : Let z ∈ (V /U)0 . If x ∈ U then π(x) = 0, and
hence (Az)(x) = z(π(x)) = z(0) = 0, so Az ∈ U ◦ for all
z ∈ (V /U)0 . Hence R(A) ⊆ U ◦ .

Let U ⊆ V be a subspace, and let π : V → V /U be the
projection.

Theorem (3.8)
There is an isomorphism (V /U)0 → U ◦ given by z 7→ z ◦ π .
In particular, if V is nite-dimensional, then
dim U + dim U ◦ = dim V .

Proof.

Let A : (V /U)0 → V 0 be the linear map Az = z ◦ π .
Goal: to show R(A) = U ◦ and N(A) = {0}. Then A induces
an isomorphism (V /U)0 → U ◦ by the rst isomorphism
theorem.
U ◦ ⊆ R(A): Let y ∈ U ◦ . Dene y : V /U → F by
y (x + U) = y (x). Well-dened since y (u) = 0 for u ∈ U .
Then y = y ◦ π = Ay , so U ◦ ⊆ R(A).

Let U ⊆ V be a subspace, and let π : V → V /U be the
projection.

Theorem (3.8)
There is an isomorphism (V /U)0 → U ◦ given by z 7→ z ◦ π .
In particular, if V is nite-dimensional, then
dim U + dim U ◦ = dim V .

Proof.

Let A : (V /U)0 → V 0 be the linear map Az = z ◦ π .
By Theorem 2.14 we have dim V = dim U + dim V /U .
By Corollary 3.5 we have dim V /U = dim(V /U)0 .
As we just proved (V /U)0 ∼
= U ◦ we get dim(V /U)0 = dim U ◦ .
Hence
dim V = dim U + dim U ◦ .

Theorem (3.8)
There is an isomorphism (V /U)0 → U ◦ given by z 7→ z ◦ π .
In particular, if V is nite-dimensional, then
dim U + dim U ◦ = dim V .

We have dim F n = n and dim U = 1. So
dim U ◦ = dim F n − dim U = n − 1.

Let U ⊆ V be a subspace, and assume dim V < ∞.

Theorem (3.9, The Extension Theorem)
For every z ∈ U 0 there exists y ∈ V 0 such that z(x) = y (x) for
all x ∈ U . (In other words, y |U = z ).

Question: is y |U = z ?
(1) Yes,

Let U ⊆ V be a subspace, and assume dim V < ∞.

Theorem (3.9, The Extension Theorem)
For every z ∈ U 0 there exists y ∈ V 0 such that z(x) = y (x) for
all x ∈ U . (In other words, y |U = z ).

Proof.

Let J : V 0 → U 0 be the restriction map J(y ) = y |U for y ∈ V 0 ,
or equivalently, J(y ) : U → F is given by J(y )(x) = y (x) for
all x ∈ U .
It is easy to check that J is linear.
Goal: show that R(J) = U 0 .
Note that N(J) = U ◦ . By the ranknullity theorem we have
Cor 3.5

dim R(J)+dim N(J) = dim V 0 = dim V
| {z }
dim U ◦

Thm3.8

=

dim U+dim U ◦

so dim R(J) = dim U = dim U 0 . As R(J) ⊆ U 0 is a subspace,
it follows that R(J) = U 0 (Corollary 1.23).

Lemma (3.10)
Suppose dim V < ∞, and let x ∈ V be non-zero. Then
y (x) 6= 0 for some y ∈ V 0 .

Proof.

Let U = span{x} = {αx : α ∈ F}, which is a 1-dimensional
subspace of V .
Dene z ∈ U 0 by z(αx) = α for α ∈ F .
By the Extension Theorem we may nd y ∈ V 0 such that
y |U = z . Hence y (x) = z(x) = 1.

Theorem (3.11, The Separation Theorem)
Let dim V < ∞ and U ⊆ V be a subspace. For each
x ∈ V \ U there exists y ∈ V 0 which annihilates U but not x ,
i.e. y (u) = 0 for all u ∈ U and y (x) 6= 0.
Alternatively (equivalently), this means
U = {x ∈ V | y (x) = 0 for all y ∈ U ◦ }.

Proof.

Let π : V → V /U be the projection. As x ∈
/ U we have
π(x) 6= 0.
By Lemma 3.10 there exists z ∈ (V /U)0 such that
z(π(x)) 6= 0.
By Theorem 3.8 y := z ◦ π ∈ U ◦ (so y annihilates U ),
and y (x) = z(π(x)) 6= 0.

Let U, V be F -vector spaces and A ∈ Hom(U, V ).

Denition

The adjoint of A is the linear map A0 : V 0 → U 0 given by

(A0 y )(x) = y (A(x)),

for all x ∈ U.

In other words, A0 y = y ◦ A.

Lemma (3.13)

Let A ∈ Hom(U, V ). Then the adjoint A0 ∈ Hom(V 0 , U 0 ) and
satises
(1) A 7→ A0 is a linear map Hom(U, V ) → Hom(V 0 , U 0 );
(2) (BA)0 = A0 B 0 for A ∈ Hom(U, V ) and B ∈ Hom(V , W );
(3) (IV )0 = IV 0 ∈ End(V 0 ).

Proof.

Straight-forward from denitions (omitted).

Corollary (3.14)

If A ∈ Hom(U, V ) is an isomorphism then so is
A0 ∈ Hom(V 0 , U 0 ), and (A0 )−1 = (A−1 )0 .

Proof.

(A−1 )0 A0 = (AA−1 )0 = (IV )0 = IV 0
A0 (A−1 )0 = (A−1 A)0 = (IU )0 = IU 0 .

Let U, V be nite dimensional vector spaces with ordered
bases B and C , let m = dim U and n = dim V .
Let A ∈ Hom(U, V ). Then C [A]B ∈ Mn,m (F).
Then A0 ∈ Hom(V 0 , U 0 ) and therefore B0 [A0 ]C 0 ∈ Mm,n (F).
Note: n and m swapped!

Denition

The vector space V 00 := (V 0 )0 is the double dual of V .
Suppose x ∈ V . Dene a map Tx : V 0 → F by
(Tx)(y ) = y (x).

Lemma (3.20, 3.22)
There is a linear map T : V → V 00 given by (Tx)(y ) = y (x)
for all x ∈ V and y ∈ V 0 .

Proof.

Straight forward from denitions.

Denition

T : V → V 00 is called the natural correspondence from V to
V 00 .

Theorem (3.23)
If dim V < ∞ then T : V → V 00 is an isomorphism.

Proof.

First we show that N(T ) = {0}, so let x ∈ V such that
Tx = 0.
Assume for contradiction that x 6= 0. By Corollary 3.10 there
is y ∈ V 0 such that y (x) 6= 0. Hence

(Tx)(y ) = y (x) 6= 0
which contradicts that Tx = 0. So x = 0, and thus
N(T ) = {0}.
By Corollary 3.5 dim V = dim V 0 = dim V 00 .
By Theorem 2.10 T is an isomorphism.

If A ∈ Hom(U, V ), then A0 ∈ Hom(V 0 , U 0 ).
Taking the adjoint of A0 , we get A00 ∈ Hom(U 00 , V 00 ).
If TU : U → U 00 and TV : V → V 00 are the natural
correspondences, we have the diagram

U 00

Lemma (3.24)
A00 ◦ TU = TV ◦ A.

In other words: the diagram above is commutative.

Proof.

Follows from unraveling the denitions.
